Welcome to our high-frequency trading software! Our platform is designed to help traders capitalize on small price movements in the market. We understand that HFT can be a challenging field, with market volatility, heavy regulation, and intense competition all posing significant pain points. That's why we have built our software to address these challenges head-on.

Our software continuously monitors the bid and ask prices for various cryptocurrencies, looking for price discrepancies between different trading pairs. When a discrepancy is detected, it places a buy order on the lower-priced pair and a sell order on the higher-priced pair, executing the trade and maximizing profits. We have also implemented features to manage risks and ensure that our traders are protected against potential losses.

In addition, our software runs on a network of execution nodes and super nodes, which work together to ensure that trades are executed quickly and efficiently. Our super nodes also perform tasks such as risk management and data monitoring, to help our traders stay on top of their performance and make informed decisions.

Overall, our software is designed to help HFT traders navigate the complex and constantly-evolving world of high-frequency trading.

### Customizing Your Trading Pairs
Ultraqubo allows users to customize which pairs they want to trade on the Binance exchange. Users can specify which pairs to exclude through the use of a blacklist file, or they can choose to only trade specific pairs by specifying a file that lists the allowed pairs. Users can also choose whether to consider all pairs listed by the exchange, or only those in the list of allowed pairs. Additionally, users can specify whether to include only pairs that are tradeable on spot or margin, and can choose to filter out pairs that are temporarily or permanently not tradeable. The configuration file also allows users to define the parameters for constructing possible arbitrage paths, including the number of jumps allowed in the path. Users can also specify the usual and special fees to be considered when calculating the profitability of a given path.

### Configurable Strategies for Customized Trading
Ultraqubo provides a range of configurable strategies for spot trading. In addition to the basic spot arbitrage strategy, we offer many more advanced options that allow users to fine-tune their trading strategies and maximize their profits. These options include the number of arbitrage paths that can be managed in parallel, the minimum speed at which trades should be performed, and the minimum and maximum quantities of arbitrage coin to be used in trades. Users can also specify the risk percentage for each strategy and the maximum and minimum spreads to be applied to trades. With these advanced configuration options, our software gives users the flexibility and control they need to succeed in the world of high-frequency trading.

### Dynamic Spreads: The Key to Success
Ultraqubo allows users to customize their trading strategies with configurable dynamic spreads. These spreads adjust the difference between the bid and ask price of a financial instrument based on the speed of execution, taking advantage of market volatility. Users can fine-tune the dynamic spread adjustment by configuring parameters such as the spread stabilization weight, the spread stabilization cap, the spread increase percentage, and the spread decrease percentage. Our software also allows users to define overrides for selected pairs, specifying custom spread parameters and modified values for specific general spread settings. With these advanced configuration options, our software gives users the flexibility and control they need to succeed in high-frequency trading.

### Filter out unprofitable arbitrage paths
Ultraqubo allows users to fine-tune their arbitrage trading strategies by configuring a variety of parameters. These include the minimum and maximum profit percentage to filter out unprofitable paths, the minimum required liquidity for the least liquid bid in a path, and the minimum time delay between attempting the same arbitrage path. The crescent capacity rule ensures that the least liquid bid is placed at the beginning of the path, and the second bid limiter determines the conditions under which the second bid is identified. In addition, ticker options allow users to specify whether further processing should occur when certain price changes are detected in the order book. By carefully setting these parameters, users can optimize their trading strategies and maximize their profits.

### Maximize Your Trading Profits with In-Depth Metrics
Ultraqubo allows users to collect and output a variety of metrics from their execution nodes. These metrics can help users identify possible ways to improve their trading strategy. The output of these metrics is timed according to the settings in the configuration file. Some examples of the metrics that can be collected include the number of successful arbitrage trades per hour, the volume of trades executed per hour, and the capital profit per hour. By analyzing these metrics, users can gain valuable insights into the performance of their trades and make informed decisions about how to optimize their strategy.

### Flexible Risk Controls
The risk module helps you manage the risk of your trades by evaluating data from Ultramonitor and the execution nodes in real time. There are a number of configurable parameters you can use to control this process, including the maximum amount you can buy or sell, the overall maximum amount you can have invested at any given time, and the maximum capital you can invest. You can also set limits on patterns and on the number of consecutive trades with increasing or decreasing prices. Additionally, you can choose to monitor all symbols or just a select few. All of these options are designed to help you make informed decisions and manage your risk more effectively.
